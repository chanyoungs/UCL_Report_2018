This is just a bare minimum to get started.  There is unlimited guidance on using latex, e.g. {\tt https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}.   You are still responsible to check the detailed requirements of a project, including formatting instructions, see \\
{\tt https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3591429/mod\_resource/content/7/UGProjects2017.pdf}.
Leave at least a line of white space when you want to start a new paragraph.

Mathematical expressions are placed inline between dollar signs, e.g. $\sqrt 2, \sum_{i=0}^nf(i)$, or in display mode
\[ e^{i\pi}=-1\] and another way, this time with labels,
\begin{align}
\label{line1} A=B\wedge B=C&\rightarrow A=C\\
&\rightarrow C=A\\
\intertext{note that}
n!&=\prod_{1\leq i\leq n}i \\
\int_{x=1}^y \frac 1 x \mathrm{d}x&=\log y
\end{align}
We can refer to labels like this \eqref{line1}.
